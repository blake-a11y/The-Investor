# Your Actions (Required)

**Every Composer Agent response must end with a "Your actions" section.**

Format:

## Your actions

| # | Action |
|---|--------|
| 1 | [Next concrete step for the user] |
| 2 | [Another step, or "None" if complete] |

- Keep 1–5 items, in order of priority
- Be specific and actionable (files to edit, commands to run, decisions to make)
- If the task is fully done, say "No further actions — task complete"
- Reference exact paths, commands, or prompts when relevant
