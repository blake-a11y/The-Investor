**# Draft Threat Assessment — Domestic Sleeper Cell Risk**  
**Agent:** Grok (xAI) | **Date:** March 1, 2026 | **Status:** Draft — Pending Audit  

**Project:** Homeland Security Investment Research 2026  
**Scenario Context:** Post-February 28, 2026 U.S.–Israel joint strikes on Iranian nuclear, missile, and senior leadership targets, with confirmed Iranian retaliation and reported deaths of senior IRGC/Quds Force figures. This assessment focuses exclusively on quantified domestic (U.S. soil) sleeper-cell activation risk for investment decision-making. All probabilities are conservative, base-rate grounded, and require ≥2 independent sources per estimate.

## 1. Executive Summary (Threat Probability)

Following the Feb 28, 2026 strikes and senior Iranian leadership losses, the domestic threat environment is **elevated but not unprecedented** relative to the Jan 2020 Soleimani assassination. Historical patterns show **no successful large-scale sleeper-cell activations** on U.S. soil in analogous triggers. U.S. law enforcement has disrupted **at least 17–27 Iranian or proxy-linked plots** since 2020, predominantly targeted assassinations or surveillance, with zero mass-casualty successes.

**Probability Tree (90-day forward window, author judgment calibrated to historical analogs + 2025 DHS/FBI/DNI assessments):**  
- **No domestic activation** (cells remain dormant or are disrupted): **72%**  
- **Cyber/infrastructure attack** (low-level DDoS, grid/financial probing): **12%**  
- **Targeted assassination** (U.S. officials, Israeli diplomats, Iranian dissidents): **11%**  
- **Coordinated physical attack** (multi-city IED/vehicle): **4%**  
- **Mass casualty event** (stadium/transit/soft target): **1%**  

**Key Drivers:** Iran’s preference for deniable proxies/criminals over direct sleeper activation; robust U.S. disruption capability; absence of a public Iranian fatwa calling for homeland violence (as of March 1, 2026).  

**Most Likely Outcome:** Continued low-level plots and cyber activity, with high probability of disruption. No evidence of imminent mass-casualty capability.  

**Investment Implications Summary:** Elevated (but containable) risk supports defensive sectors (physical security, cybersecurity, critical infrastructure protection). See Section 7.

## 2. Historical Base Rate Analysis

**Post-Soleimani Assassination (Jan 3, 2020):**  
DHS NTAS Bulletin (Jan 4, 2020) and subsequent 2020–2025 assessments: Iran/Hezbollah demonstrated “intent and capability” for U.S. operations but **no specific credible homeland threat materialized**. No sleeper-cell attacks occurred. Monitoring spiked; multiple plots disrupted over following years (DHS Homeland Threat Assessment 2025; CTC West Point “Tehran’s Homeland Option,” 2025). Base-rate activation: 0% for physical attacks.

**1979–1981 Iranian Hostage Crisis:**  
No documented Iranian-proxy or sleeper-cell activity on U.S. soil. Crisis confined to Tehran embassy seizure and diplomatic fallout (U.S. State Dept Historical Office; Brookings Institution analysis, 2019). Zero domestic activations.

**Post-9/11 “Second Wave” Threat (2001–2002):**  
FBI disrupted dozens of plots in first 90–180 days (e.g., “Day of Terror” follow-ons, shoe-bomber attempt, Padilla dirty-bomb plot). Successful attacks on U.S. soil: zero in immediate window beyond initial event. High disruption rate due to elevated alert posture (9/11 Commission Report; CSIS “Escalating Terrorism Problem,” 2020).

**Hezbollah Sleeper Network Assessments:**  
U.S. networks exist but are small and primarily surveillance/support-oriented. Notable case: Ali Kourani (convicted 2019) self-identified as part of a “sleeper cell” conducting airport/military surveillance in NY/Toronto for potential activation in U.S.-Iran conflict scenario (DOJ/SDNY; Washington Institute, 2019). RAND and CRS reports emphasize Hezbollah’s larger Latin America footprint over U.S. operational cells (RAND PEA3585-1, 2025; CRS IF10703, 2024). Estimated U.S. operatives: low dozens, not hundreds in coordinated cells.

**IRGC-Linked Plots on U.S. Soil (2022–2025):**  
DOJ/FBI: At least 10+ publicly charged plots, primarily murder-for-hire against officials (Bolton/Pompeo 2022), dissidents (Masih Alinejad 2024), or critics. All used criminal proxies or third-country nationals, **none activated as traditional sleeper cells**. Zero successful attacks (DOJ press releases 2022–2024; DHS HTA 2025).

**Overall Historical Activation Rate Post-Major Trigger:** <5% for any physical attack; 0% for mass casualty in U.S. homeland.

## 3. Current Threat Environment (Sourced)

- **DHS National Terrorism Advisory System (NTAS) Bulletin, June 22, 2025 (most recent public analog; threat posture unchanged as of March 1, 2026 per ongoing conflict):** “Ongoing Iran conflict causing heightened threat environment.” Notes Iran’s long-standing intent to target U.S. officials for Soleimani killing; disrupted “multiple potentially lethal Iranian-backed plots” since 2020. Low-level cyber by pro-Iran actors observed. No specific credible plot to homeland as of bulletin.
- **DHS Homeland Threat Assessment 2025:** Iran “primary sponsor of terrorism”; continues plots against U.S. officials and dissidents using U.S. persons, diaspora, or third-country nationals. Transnational repression via surveillance/harassment/violence.
- **FBI Iran Threat Page (updated 2025):** Active counterterrorism against IRGC/Hezbollah; multiple disrupted assassination and material-support cases.
- **DNI Annual Threat Assessment 2025 (Unclassified):** Iran seeks deniable operations; proxy networks (Hezbollah) remain concern but focus remains regional with homeland plots opportunistic.
- **START Global Terrorism Database + Washington Institute Dataset:** 27+ Iranian-linked plots in U.S. since 2011; vast majority foiled; no successful mass-casualty events.

Consensus: Threat is **persistent but low-execution** due to U.S. disruption and Iran’s preference for plausible deniability.

## 4. Probability Tree with Source Citations

(Each branch cites ≥2 independent sources; calibrated to Soleimani analog + 2025 assessments + current strike severity.)

- **No domestic activation (72%)**  
  Grounded in: Post-Soleimani (DHS NTAS Jan 2020 + DHS HTA 2025: no attacks despite threats); IRGC plots 2022–2025 (all disrupted, DOJ/FBI). Cells typically remain dormant or are rolled up.

- **Cyber/infrastructure attack (12%)**  
  Grounded in: NTAS June 2025 (“low-level cyber attacks against U.S. networks by pro-Iranian actors”); DHS HTA 2025 (Iranian hacker groups exploiting vulnerabilities in response to Israel support). Precedent in past Iranian cyber campaigns.

- **Targeted assassination (11%)**  
  Grounded in: Multiple IRGC murder-for-hire plots 2022–2025 (DOJ: Bolton/Pompeo/Alinejad cases); DHS HTA 2025 (“intent to kill U.S. officials responsible for Soleimani”). Most common execution method.

- **Coordinated physical attack (4%)**  
  Grounded in: Hezbollah sleeper surveillance cases (Kourani DOJ conviction + Washington Institute 2019/2025 analysis); rare but possible if fatwa issued (NTAS conditional language).

- **Mass casualty event (1%)**  
  Grounded in: Zero historical precedent on U.S. soil (START GTD + CRS reports); requires coordination beyond observed capabilities (DNI ATA 2025 + CTC West Point).

## 5. Timing Assessment

- **Typical Lag (historical data):** Immediate rhetorical threats (days); plot development/surveillance (weeks–months); activation attempts (0–90 days most common if any).  
- **Most Dangerous Window:** 0–30 days (inspiration/self-radicalization spike, per NTAS); 30–90 days for planned proxy plots (Soleimani pattern + DHS 2025). 90–180 days lower as U.S. posture hardens.  
- **Accelerators:** Public Iranian religious ruling/fatwa; perceived existential regime threat.  
- **Delayers:** U.S. law-enforcement surge (FBI reassignments noted June 2025); internal Iranian post-strike chaos; effective proxy deniability failure.

---

## 6. Target Profile

Most likely (per DHS HTA 2025 + FBI + NTAS 2025):  
- **Primary:** U.S. government officials (Soleimani revenge); Iranian dissidents/journalists (transnational repression).  
- **Secondary:** Israeli/Jewish community sites (soft targets via proxies); critical infrastructure via cyber (grid, financial, water – low-level).  
- **Lower Probability:** Military installations (hardened); economic targets (ports/pipelines – require coordination rarely observed).

## 7. Investment Implications (Sector Mapping)

This assessment is **investment research only** — not a policy document.

- **High-Conviction Tailwinds (No Activation or Cyber/Targeted scenarios — 95% combined probability):**  
  - Cybersecurity & critical infrastructure protection (elevated cyber probing).  
  - Physical security/tech (surveillance, access control for officials/dissidents).  
  - Defense contractors with homeland security exposure (already positioned in prior event-driven allocation).  

- **Moderate Tailwinds (Coordinated Physical — 4%):**  
  - Private security, border/tech screening, insurance (terror risk riders).  

- **Low Relevance (Mass Casualty — 1%):** Avoid over-rotation; markets price in disruption history.

**Recommended Overlay to Feb 28 Event-Driven Allocation:** Maintain 35/30/20/15 core but consider 5–10% satellite sleeve in cybersecurity/defensive tech names for asymmetric protection against the 12–15% cyber/targeted branches. Reassess at 30-day mark.
