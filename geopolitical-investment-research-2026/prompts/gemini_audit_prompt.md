# Gemini Audit Prompt

**Prompt:**
> Audience: Wealth-Tech Operations Leader (see `prompts/persona_wealth_tech_operations.md`).
> Audit the attached Grok report for factual accuracy, logical gaps, and MC validity. Mark every claim that needs verification.
> Verify the Investor Profile/Suitability section: Are risk tolerance, time horizon, and behavioral factors justified with evidence?
> Flag claims supported by only one source. Require at least two data points for material assertions.

**Output:** Save to `reports/audit_gemini.md`
